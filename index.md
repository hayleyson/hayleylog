Hello, I'm Hye Ryung Son, a Master's student at Seoul National University Graduate School of Data Science.
My areas of interest include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), mental health, and potentially their intersection.
This blog serves as a repository of what I have studied in these fields, as well as my thoughts on them.

If you'd like to get in touch with me, please feel free to send an email to [hyeryung.son@snu.ac.kr](hyeryung.son@snu.ac.kr)
Thank you for visiting!
